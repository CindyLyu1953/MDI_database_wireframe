We report results from a randomized controlled trial in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), exploring the effects of exposure to social media during 1 wk around genocide remembrance in July 2019 on a set of interethnic attitudes of Facebook users. We find evidence that, counter to preregistered expectations, people who deactivated their Facebook profiles report lower regard for ethnic outgroups than those who remained active. Moreover, we present additional evidence suggesting that this effect is likely conditional on the level of ethnic heterogeneity of respondents’ residence. We also extend the analysis to include measures of subjective well-being and knowledge of news. Here, we find that Facebook deactivation leads to suggestive improvements in subjective wellbeing and a decrease in knowledge of current events, replicating results from recent research in the United States in a very different context, thus increasing our confidence in the generalizability of these effects.",Deactivation from Facebook for one week (treatment) vs. continued normal Facebook use (control).,"Our treatment of Facebook deactivation took place from 7 July until 14 July 2019, encompassing the week around the Remembrance Day (11 July) of the genocide in Srebrenica.

Outcome: Out-Group Feeling Thermometer 

Q: Academically-run national surveys in the United States often use something we call the feeling thermometer to understand how people feel about different individuals and groups. The question about feelings between groups has been included in every American National Election Studies since 1968. Given that there are different ethnic groups living in BiH, we'd like you to rate the groups in the following way: Indicate on a 101-point scale how warm you feel towards the members of the other ethnic groups in BiH. Ratings between 50 degrees and 100 degrees mean that you feel favorable and warm toward the group. Ratings between 0 degrees and 50 degrees mean that you do not feel favorable toward the group, and you would select the 50 degree mark if you have no feelings one way or the other.

Hence, it appears that the negative effect of Facebook deactivation on outgroup regard is almost entirely driven by users within the communities in which the opportunities for offline intergroup contact are limited (and in some cases possibly nonexistent), and they therefore may be living within offline echo chambers that are stronger than the ones users find online. ...

To explore this question, we replicate the only published study to date that tests the effects of social media cessation on interethnic attitudes (Asimovic et al., 2021). In a study situated in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the authors found that deactivating from Facebook for a week around genocide commemoration in Bosnia and Herzegovina had a negative effect on users' attitudes toward ethnic outgroups, with the negative effect driven by users with more ethnically homogenous offline networks. Does this finding extend to other settings? In a pre-registered replication study, we implement the same research design in a different ethnically polarized setting: Cyprus. We are not able to replicate the main effect found in Asimovic et al. (2021): in Cyprus, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no effect.

Journal of Communication, 00, 1-25. doi: 10.1093/joc/jqab034","Though prior studies have analyzed the textual characteristics of online comments about politics, less is known about how selection into commenting behavior and exposure to other people’s comments changes the tone and content of political discourse. This article makes three contributions. First, we show that frequent commenters on Facebook are more likely to be interested in politics, to have more polarized opinions, and to use toxic language in comments in an elicitation task. Second, we find that people who comment on articles in the real world use more toxic language on average than the public as a whole; levels of toxicity in comments scraped from media outlet Facebook pages greatly exceed what is observed in comments we elicit on the same articles from a nationally representative sample. Finally, we demonstrate experimentally that exposure to toxic language in comments increases the toxicity of subsequent comments.",Commenting frequency; Exposure to top Facebook comments (two most-liked),"During the survey, we asked YouGov respondents to comment on articles drawn from Facebook. Each respondent was randomly assigned to see three different articles from the Facebook sample. In each case, respondents were presented with a Facebook post from a news outlet and asked whether they would write a comment if they saw the post on Facebook and subsequently what they would write. ... The comment elicitation task also included an embedded survey experiment. To test whether prior comments cause people to make uncivil comments themselves (especially if the prior comments are uncivil), we randomized whether respondents were shown two real comments from Facebook on each post or not. When assigned to the comments condition, respondents were specifically shown the two comments with the most likes for each post, which are frequently highlighted by the Facebook algorithm.","Comment toxicity; Willingness to write a comment; Political engagement/involvement (political interest, political knowledge, partisan strength, need to evaluate); Political polarization (affective and ideological)","To measure comment toxicity, we used the toxicity machine learning model implemented in Google's Perspective API (Wulczyn, Thain, & Dixon, 2017). This model is trained on labeled data from sources including human moderator-tagged online comments in Wikipedia's talk pages and the New York Times comments section. The toxicity score, which ranges from 0 to 1, indicates the predicted proportion of annotators classifying the comment as “a rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable comment that is likely to make people leave a discussion.”","Outcome: Commenting behavior Facebook use

As shown in models 1-5, we do not find a significant treatment effect on willingness to comment. Furthermore, we do not find that (randomized) exposure to top featured comments increases toxicity when averaged across all articles (model 6). However, the toxicity of top comments is significantly associated with the toxicity of respondents’ comments (p < 0.005; model 7). Importantly, this association is much stronger for those assigned to see the featured comments (0.18) than those who weren’t (0.09), and the difference between those quantities (0.09) is statistically significant (p < 0.05; model 8). These results hold when we include article fixed effects (Columns 9–10).","Commenters vs. non-commenters: Commenters have higher political interest (by 11-24 pp, p<.005), political knowledge (p<.005 in ANES/Pew), strong partisanship (p<.005), and need to evaluate (p<.005). 

Toxicity: Real-world Facebook comments are 77% more toxic on average than comments elicited from a representative sample (mean toxicity 0.33 vs. 0.19, p<.005). Frequent commenters in the YouGov survey write more toxic comments than non-commenters (0.22 vs 0.18, p<.005). Toxicity and likes: The number of 'likes' on Facebook comments increases with toxicity up to the 80th percentile of toxicity (score=0.53), and then declines. 

Experimental effects: Exposure to top comments does not affect willingness to comment. Exposure to toxic featured comments increases the toxicity of subsequent comments. Exposure to comments with the highest toxicity (≈.9) increases respondent comment toxicity from 0.21 to 0.33, an effect of approximately 0.5 SD.","The results show that commenters’ self-reported interest in politics is higher than non-commenters by 11–24 percentage points (p <.005 in each case). Habitual commenters are also more likely to be more informed about politics (p <.005 in ANES and Pew; p <.1 in YouGov) and to identify themselves as strong partisans (p <.005 in each case). Furthermore, commenters exhibit significantly stronger need to evaluate (p <.005). The average toxicity scores for the Facebook and YouGov samples are respectively 0.330 and 0.186. In other words, toxicity of real world comments surpasses toxicity of comments by the general public by 77%—a substantial gap. Being exposed to the worst comments in the pool (toxicity ≈.9) increases the toxicity of respondents’ comments from 0.21 to 0.33, an estimated effect of approximately 0.5 standard deviations when featured comment toxicity is at its maximum.

Imagine during the Second World War, there were surely many French, believe me, who had good reasons to flee the Germans; and yet, they went to fight against the Germans.” Screen 2 Pensions and work: in the program of the Front National, immigration is presented as being used by big firms to push wages down. This follows a number of statements by Marine Le Pen relative to work and retirement benefits going to refugees: 8/12/2016: “Without mentioning the policies that allow people to obtain a minimum pension under the single condition of coming to France and being above 65, i.e., without having ever worked or paid social contributions in France; and we hand out 750 euros per person, 1500 euros for a couple (...) close to you there are farmers who live with 300 or 400 euros.” 27/11/2013: “5% of the foreigners who come to France have a work contract. This means that there is 95% who come to France who are taken care of by our nation (...). There are 95% of people who settle in France who don't work, either because of their age, either because they cannot as there is no work in France.” 08/12/2016: “But they [the immigrant population] do not work. They do not work. There are seven million unemployed in our country. How could they work? They do not work, these lies have to stop.” Treatment: Facts You will read below several numbers and statistics about migrants, related to their reasons to come and their impact on French working and retired population; please read them carefully. Screen 1 Reasons to come According to the UNHCR, among the migrants crossing the Mediterranean in 2015, the vast majority was coming from countries at war or in conflict, 50% were Syrians, 21% Afghans, 9% Iraqis and 4% Eritreans. The UNHCR estimates that among the migrants crossing the Mediterranean in 2015, 17% are women, 25% are children and 58% are men. During the First and Second World Wars, the French fled war zones in much larger numbers than the current refugees. After the defeat of the French army in the North of France in the Spring 1940, 8 million civilians, that is one quarter (25%) of the population of the time, took the road to go to the South of the country that was not occupied (according to Jean-Pierre Azema, a renowned French historian). Screen 2 Pensions and work The “old age minimum” guarantees elderly people a minimum of 801 euros for people above 65. This social benefit is available to all French nationals, under the condition of being below a certain level of income. It is also available to foreigners, under the condition of meeting at least one of the following requirements: have a work visa for the past 10 years. Have the refugee status or benefit from French protection for having fought under the French flag. Be a national from a EU state or from Switzerland. According to the National Statistics Institute (INSEE) in 2015, 54.8% of the immigrant population were in the labor force (working or looking for a job) against 56.3% for the rest of the French population. The rate of unemployment for the immigrant population is 18.1% against 9.1% for the rest of the population. There is therefore 44.9% of the immigrant population that works (51.1% for the rest of the population).

The variation in prior beliefs about the unemployment rate among migrants allows us to study the heterogeneity of the effects of the treatments with respect to prior knowledge. As described above, we measure the correctness of the prior with three dummy variables: correct, overestimated, and underestimated unemployment rate among migrants. Tables A6 and A7 in the online appendix explore potentially relevant dimensions of heterogeneity of treatment effects on the main political outcomes (voting intentions, the dummy for a belief that refugees come for economic reason, and a dummy for agreement with MLP on immigration policy) and on posteriors on facts (absolute value of the distance to truth on the posterior beliefs about the share of men among refugees and absolute value of the distance to truth on the posterior about the share of working among migrants). Each panel of these Tables presents the coefficients on the interaction terms between each treatment and a particular characteristic from five different regressions.","Test/Interaction: Treatment effect heterogeneity by prior knowledge. Models included interaction terms between treatment dummies and a dummy for having a correct prior (vs. overestimated prior). 

Result: The persuasive effects of all three treatments (Alt-Facts, Fact-Check, and Facts) on voting intention for MLP were large, positive, and statistically significant only for the subgroup of respondents who overestimated the unemployment rate among migrants. For this group, the Alt-Facts treatment increased voting intentions by 8.2 pp (p<0.01), Fact-Check by 6.8 pp (p<0.05), and Facts by 4.8 pp (p<0.1). For respondents with correct priors, the effects were small and not significant. The interaction term 'Alt-Facts x Correct prior' was -0.122 (p<0.05), indicating a significantly smaller effect for those with correct priors. 

Test/Interaction: Treatment effect heterogeneity by primary news source (TV vs. others). 

Result: Among those who get news from TV, the Alt-Facts treatment had a significantly larger effect on voting intention (interaction coef. = 0.093, p<0.05) and belief that refugees come for economic reasons (interaction coef. = 0.118, p<0.05). 

Test/Interaction: Treatment effect heterogeneity by income source (receiving social security vs. others). 

Result: Among social security recipients, the Facts treatment had a significantly smaller effect on voting intention (interaction coef. = -0.125, p<0.05).

Result: For those with secondary education, the Fact-Check and Facts treatments had a significantly stronger effect on correcting factual knowledge (reducing distance to truth).

Overperception of moral outrage in online social networks inflates beliefs about intergroup hostility. *Nature Human Behaviour*, *7*(6), 917–927.","As individuals and political leaders increasingly interact in online social networks, it is important to understand the dynamics of emotion perception online. Here, we propose that social media users overperceive levels of moral outrage felt by individuals and groups, inflating beliefs about intergroup hostility. Using a Twitter field survey, we measured authors' moral outrage in real time and compared authors' reports to observers' judgements of the authors' moral outrage. We find that observers systematically overperceive moral outrage in authors, inferring more intense moral outrage experiences from messages than the authors of those messages actually reported. This effect was stronger in participants who spent more time on social media to learn about politics. Preregistered confirmatory behavioural experiments found that overperception of individuals' moral outrage causes overperception of collective moral outrage and inflates beliefs about hostile communication norms, group affective polarization and ideological extremity. Together, these results highlight how individual-level overperceptions of online moral outrage produce collective overperceptions that have the potential to warp our social knowledge of moral and political attitudes.","The emotion rating (author self-report vs. independent observer judgment), 
experimentally manipulated content of a simulated Twitter newsfeed. ","For these experiments, we leveraged the database of author tweets that we gathered in studies 1 and 2 to create simulated Twitter newsfeeds. For each tweet in our database, we had access to the author’s self-reported outrage, as well as the mean of at least ten observers’ judgements of outrage (Fig. 4a). These pairs of author self-reports and observer mean judgements enabled us to construct two sets of tweets: ‘high-overperception’ tweets where the observers reported notably more outrage than the authors reported and ‘low-overperception’ tweets, where the observers’ judged outrage and authors’ self-report were within 1.5 scale points on average (Methods). From these tweets, we constructed two simulated Twitter newsfeeds: a high-overperception newsfeed composed of highly overperceived tweets and a low-overperception newsfeed composed of less over-perceived tweets. Crucially, these feeds were matched in the level of outrage self-reported by tweet authors (Fig. 4b).","Perceived moral outrage;

Studies 4-5: Preregistered confirmatory behavioural experiments with random assignment.","To test for overperception of outrage and its consequences for intergroup outcomes, we developed a methodology that allowed us to measure the outrage felt by social media users when they posted a message and then compare it to observer judgements of the authors’ outrage. Across three field studies, we find evidence for systematic overperception of individuals’ outrage on Twitter; namely, that observers perceive more outrage than is reported by authors. In a preregistered confirmatory experiment using a simulated Twitter newsfeed, we manipulated overperception of individuals’ outrage and found that when participants view a newsfeed containing outrage expressions that tend to be overperceived, it causes perceptions of collective outrage of the social network to increase. A second preregistered experiment found that viewing overperceived outrage messages also amplified participants' beliefs about (1) norms of outrage expression, (2) affective polarization and (3) ideological extremity present in the network.","The main analyses in Studies 1-3 used a multilevel model to test for overperception. The model predicted outrage/happiness ratings from a dummy-coded 'source' variable (author vs. observer). The model included random intercepts for tweet ID and observer ID to account for non-independence of observations. 

The structure was: Rating ~ Source + (1|Tweet_ID) + (1|Observer_ID). Other analyses used Pearson correlations to test for associations (e.g., between overperception and social media use), independent-samples t-tests to compare means between experimental conditions (Studies 4 and 5), and a two-way ANOVA to test for an interaction effect for the affective polarization outcome in Study 5.","To test whether observers were overperceiving the outrage/happiness in authors’ tweets, we used a generalized linear model with judgements of outrage/happiness clustered by observer (every observer judged 15 authors/tweets) and author id and tweet id entered as random factors. Fixed effects estimated the difference in outrage values between authors and observers. For the main analyses, overperception of outrage and happiness were tested in two separate models but see Supplementary Section 1.2 for a model fit using both emotion judgements. We used the lmer function in the lme4 package in R v.3.4.3. All data and analysis scripts are available at https://osf.io/gtwsk/. ... To test for differences in judgements of collective outrage between groups, we conducted an independent-samples t-test adjusting for unequal variances.

Life satisfaction refers to the cognitive dimension of well-being and is considered to be a core measure of people’s well-being.15,24 To examine potential changes in the participants’ cognitive well-being, the following question was asked as the very first question in all questionnaires: “In general, how satisfied are you with your life today?” (1 [very dissatisfied] to 10 [very satisfied]) (the wording was borrowed from Eurofound25).b Emotions. Participants’ affective well-being (emotions) was measured on a total of nine items. To minimize participant burden, participants were asked to evaluate their emotions on a subset of five items from the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale26 and a subset of four items from the Positive Affect Negative Affect Scale (PANAS).27 The chosen items were the ones that showed the strongest factorial loadings on negative/depressed affect and positive affect, according to the authors. On a 5-point Likert scale, the participants were asked to report to which degree they were experiencing enthusiasm, happiness, loneliness, enjoyment of life, depressiveness, sadness, decisiveness, anger, and worry (1 [not at all] to 5 [to a great extent]).","Outcome: Life satisfaction

This comparison was based on an Intention-To-Treat (ITT) analysis, where all participants were analyzed in the group to which they were randomized, regardless of noncompliance. The statistical tests used were t-tests to compare the means of the two groups on life satisfaction and emotions. For moderation analysis, the sample was divided into subgroups based on intensity of use, envy, and active/passive use, and t-tests were conducted within these subgroups.","The aim of this study was to identify if the use of Facebook is causally affecting the users’ cognitive and affective well-being.

As the noncompliers were kept in the samples, the results should be considered as conservative estimates of the true treatment effects. Well-being.

H3, H4, and H5 were tested by comparing the causal effects on relevant subgroups in each area. H3 predicted that the effect of quitting Facebook was greater for heavy Facebook users compared to light users. Three levels of Facebook usage intensity were identified and the participants were divided according to their answers on the Facebook Intensity Scale.21 The analyses were conducted on the combined, standardized wellbeing measure. Light Facebook users had no effect of quitting Facebook, t(152)=0.74, p=0.46. In contrast, medium users had some effect, t(462)=3.18, p=0.002. Heavy users experienced the greatest effect by quitting Facebook, t(265)=4.54, p<0.001. H3 is therefore supported, proving the effect of quitting Facebook to be greatest for heavy users and to be nonexistent for light Facebook users. The statistics is shown in Table 2. Facebook envy. H4 predicted that the well-being effect of quitting Facebook varied across feelings of Facebook envy. Three levels of Facebook envy were identified and the participants were divided according to their reported level of Facebook envy. Again, the analyses were conducted on the combined, standardized, well-being measure. Participants feeling low Facebook envy had no effect, t(280)=-1.53, p=0.13, while participants feeling medium Facebook envy had a considerable effect, t(419)=4.21, p<0.001. Participants who reported to feel high Facebook envy had a significant effect, t(189)=6.31, p<0.001. Therefore, H3 is supported. The effect of quitting Facebook is greatest for users feeling high levels of Facebook envy. The statistics is shown in Table 3. Active and passive Facebook use. H5 predicted that people using Facebook passively would have a greater wellbeing effect of quitting Facebook than people using Facebook actively. An important distinction should be mentioned here. Passive and active Facebook use refers to two kinds of behavior that are not mutually exclusive. A given Facebook user may use Facebook actively and passively. Hence, the present results should be examined as follows. Passive Facebook use refers to users who report using Facebook passively (and potentially also actively) and active Facebook use refers to users who report using Facebook actively (and potentially also passively). A t-test showed that the effect of quitting Facebook was significantly greater for people using Facebook passively compared to their reference group (users who do not use Facebook passively). This result is in line with previous studies that find correlational evidence that passive Facebook use affects users’ affective and cognitive well-being negatively.6,7 In general, people who report using Facebook actively did experience a positive effect compared to their reference group (users who do not use Facebook actively), but the difference was marginal, indicating that people using Facebook actively have more or less the same effect of quitting Facebook as their reference group.

$15 completion bonus; 
Treatment paid $102 for deactivation","All participants received $5 per completed survey, paid via gift card immediately upon completion. All participants were told that they would receive a $15 “completion payment” if they completed all surveys, responded to 75 percent of text messages, kept their accounts deactivated for the 24 hours after midline and endline, and, if the deactivation offer price was above their reported WTA, kept their accounts deactivated for the full period between midline and endline. The latter requirement (making the completion payment contingent on complying with the BDM’s deactivation assignment) makes it a strictly dominant (instead of weakly dominant) strategy to truthfully report valuations in the BDM. These payments were in addition to the $102 that the Treatment group received in exchange for deactivation.",Randomized experiment ,"In this paper, we report on a large-scale randomized evaluation of the welfare impacts of Facebook, focusing on US users in the run-up to the November 2018 midterm elections.","The primary analysis estimates the local average treatment effect (LATE) of Facebook deactivation using an instrumental variable (IV) regression. The main estimation equation is: Yᵢ = τDᵢ + ρYᵢᵇ + νₛ + εᵢ. In this model, Yᵢ is the endline outcome for individual i, Dᵢ is the proportion of time that individual i's account was observed to be deactivated, Yᵢᵇ is a vector of baseline covariates (including the baseline value of the outcome and its corresponding index), and νₛ are dummies for the 48 randomization strata. The treatment assignment indicator Tᵢ (1 for Treatment, 0 for Control) is used as an instrument for Dᵢ. Heterogeneity is explored using an interaction term in a modified equation: Yᵢ = τDᵢ + αᵏDᵢXᵢᵏ + ζXᵢᵏ + ρYᵢᵇ + νₛ + εᵢ, where Xᵢᵏ is a moderator and Dᵢ and DᵢXᵢᵏ are instrumented with Tᵢ and TᵢXᵢᵏ.","To estimate the local average treatment effect (LATE) of Facebook deactivation, define Yᵢ as some outcome measured at endline, and Yᵢᵇ as a vector including the baseline value of the outcome and the baseline value of the index that includes the outcome. Define Dᵢ as the percent of deactivation checks between October 13 and November 7 that person i is observed to be deactivated. Define Tᵢ ∈ {1,0} as a Treatment group indicator, and νₛ as the vector of the 48 stratum dummies. We estimate local average treatment effects of deactivation using the following regression: (1) Yᵢ = τDᵢ + ρYᵢᵇ + νₛ + εᵢ, instrumenting for Dᵢ with Tᵢ. In equation (1), τ measures the local average treatment effect of deactivation for people induced to deactivate by the promised $102 payment.",Individual participant,"The base sample for all regressions is the “impact evaluation sample”; again, participants who were willing to accept less than $102 to deactivate in weeks 1–4 (the four weeks after midline) and were offered p = $102 or p = $0 to do so. For the political polarization outcomes, the sample includes only Democrats and Republicans, as well as independents who lean toward one party or the other. Sample sizes sometimes differ across outcomes due to missing data: for example, the post-endline survey has higher non-response than the endline survey, and many participants do not have Twitter accounts.","Substitute time uses index: coefficient = 0.14 SD, p = 0.03

The Treatment group actually spent less time on both non-Facebook social media and other online activities, while devoting more time to a range of offline activities such as watching television alone and spending time with friends and family. Consistent with the reported reduction in news consumption, we find that Facebook deactivation significantly reduced news knowledge and attention to politics. The Treatment group was less likely to say they follow news about politics or the President, and less able to correctly answer factual questions about recent news events. Our overall index of news knowledge fell by 0.19 standard deviations. ... Deactivation significantly reduced polarization of views on policy issues and a measure of exposure to polarizing news. ...

Result: People with more positive baseline opinions about Facebook are less likely to decrease their post-experiment use and less likely to think that deactivation was good for them.","We highlight three key results. First, deactivation may reduce polarization more (i.e., Facebook use may increase polarization more) for older people, white people, and men. Second, Facebook deactivation has less positive effect on subjective well-being for people who have more offline social interactions and are already more happy at baseline. This suggests that Facebook use may have the unfortunate effect of reducing SWB more for people with greater social and psychological need. In our sample, these “higher-need” people also use Facebook more heavily. Third, people may have some intuition about whether they will like deactivation: people with more positive baseline opinions about Facebook are less likely to decrease their post-experiment use and less likely to think that deactivation was good for them.","Income under $50,000:

Yet, we know little about the economic effects for users. In 2017, we ran a large field experiment with over 1765 individuals to document the value of Facebook to users and its causal effect on news, well-being and daily activities. Participants reveal how much they value one week of Facebook usage and are then randomly assigned to a validated Facebook restriction or normal use. One week of Facebook is worth $67. Those who are off Facebook for one week reduce news consumption, are less likely to recognize politically-skewed news stories, report being less depressed and engage in healthier activities. These results are strongest for men. Our results further suggest that, after the restriction, Facebook’s value increases, consistent with information loss or that using Facebook may be addictive.",One-week Facebook restriction (Treatment) vs. normal use (Control),"Upon completion of the survey, participants were randomly assigned to either a one-week Facebook restriction or no restriction based on the last digit of the participant’s university-assigned ID number.

The equation is: Yit = β0 + β1*PostSurvey_t + β2*PostSurvey_t * Treatment_i + αi + εit. Yit is the outcome for individual i at time t. PostSurvey_t is a dummy variable for the post-treatment survey (Phase 3).

The remaining participants formed a control group that was paid to deactivate for just the first of those six weeks.

","This paper focuses on the three emotional state questions that were also included: “Please tell us how much of the time during the past four weeks you felt [happy / depressed / anxious].” The response options were “All of the time,” “Often,” “Sometimes,” “Rarely,” and “Never.” We code these responses as 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0, respectively, and then standardize each to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one in the sample-weighted combined Control groups, giving the variables happy, depressed, and anxious. We re-sign depressed and anxious as depressed x (-1) and anxious x (-1), so that more positive values correspond to more positive emotional state.

The assigned treatment (Deactivation vs. Control group) serves as the instrument for the measure of deactivation compliance. The estimating equation is: Yᵢ = τDᵢ + ρXᵢ + vₛ + εᵢ, where Yᵢ is the outcome for participant i, Dᵢ is deactivation compliance, Xᵢ is a vector of control variables (selected by lasso regression and including baseline outcomes and demographics), and vₛ is a vector of randomization stratum indicators.

The messages focused on: (i) addiction, highlighting the addictive nature of social media; (ii) privacy, emphasizing the public nature of online behaviour; (iii) misinformation, encouraging diverse and accurate information-seeking; and (iv) civility, fostering a tolerant and civil online environment (see the electronic supplementary material, appendix S2). Addiction Message (Delivered 12 April 2022): How much of your life is absorbed by screens? According to a scientific study, beyond 30 minutes of exposure to social networks, there is a danger for our mental health*. More generally, a correlation can be established between the time spent on digital platforms and a decrease in well-being**. The risks for mental health are numerous and proven: anxiety, negative selfimage, depression, paranoia, among others. Disconnecting from screens, resisting information overload, means taking back control of your life, your attention, your emotional balance. 3 things you could do: Suppress the applications from your mobile phone so that you are not tempted to use them. Engage in offline activities and discussions with real people. Read offline news media (newspapers, journals and magazines). Privacy Message (Delivered 14 April 2022): Your privacy is exploited and your access to the world is limited. As soon as you connect to the Internet, your personal data is collected and used for advertising purposes: you are a source of revenue. This collection of your personal data also allows digital interfaces (social networks, search engines, sites) to offer you targeted content based on your presumed tastes. The consequences: You will never know how much information is being retrieved about you and your activity. You will never have access to the world’s information like your neighbor. The risks: You have no real control over your personal data. You may find yourself “imprisoned” in a distorted vision of the world, or even indoctrinated with your own beliefs*. This is detrimental to democratic debate and can lead you to a disconnected perception of the real world’s diversity and priorities. 3 things you could do: Try to navigate in “private mode” and to regularly erase your browser’s search history. If you would like to see how your information is collected and shared by online platforms, you can use this software created by the CNIL for information purposes: https://linc.cnil.fr/fr/cookieviz-une-dataviz-entemps-reel-du-tracking-de-votre-navigation. You can download an information brochure about the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): https://www.droit-technologie.org/wpcontent/uploads/2016/11/annexes/dossier/274-1.pdf Misinformation Message (Delivered 21 April 2022): Misinformation only exists if we don’t know where the information comes from. On the Internet, information circulates very quickly, often before we even know where it comes from. Information is sometimes relayed without any knowledge of its origin or veracity, and real information stands next to false information in an often undetectable way. False information or “fake news” is promoted either with a bad intention, an interest (political, economic), or simply to take advantage of the online visibility and the revenues they generate. In all cases, the victim is you. Misinformation has a major impact on political life and threatens democratic debate: it can cause political polarization*, serve hidden interests and deprive you of the right to have an objective perception of the issues. Misinformation can lead you to have a distorted perception of political agendas and a distorted view of political debates. 3 things you could do: Always check who is/are the author(s) or the owner(s) of the website and the type of platform. Cross-check the information with other media platforms, other views and try to find scientific sources on the topic. Before you share any content, try to identify: who made it; what is the source; where did it come from; why are you sharing this; when was it published? Civility and Tolerance Message (Delivered 22 April 2022): Civility and tolerance for a better democratic debate. Online content (messages, news feeds, blog posts, articles, etc.) can trigger extreme emotional reactions. Freedom of expression should never lead to harassment. Freedom of expression should never lead to hate speech. A free and quality democratic debate implies being able to accept different opinions, without locking oneself into a position that excludes others. Studies have shown that media platforms (such as YouTube) drive audiences towards politically extreme content*. 3 things you could do: Restrain from any emotional comments on the Internet. When you disagree with a view or consider it inaccurate, do not enter into a confrontation. Do online research to avoid viewing the content that is suggested by media platforms (like YouTube).","Subjective well-being (index of life satisfaction, joy, fulfillment, anxiety, boredom, loneliness, depression, isolation);

The results seem to be especially driven by people reporting that they felt more positive emotions (joy and fulfilled) as well as higher life satisfaction in both the midline and endline surveys across both treatment arms. participants randomly assigned to the deactivation only treatment group were less knowledgeable about current political events on the endline survey (d = −0.07, p = 0.003, Q = 0.016; electronic supplementary material, appendix S5.2 and table S13).

With respect to partisan affective polarization, we hypothesized that because college-educated individuals tend to have higher levels of partisan affective polarization [28], Facebook deactivation would lower partisan affective polarization among this subgroup relative to non-college-educated individuals. Finally, with respect to social affective polarization, we hypothesized that Facebook deactivation would have a larger negative effect on individuals without a college education relative to those with a college education because education is negatively correlated with prejudice and ethnocentrism [29].","Test/Interaction: Treatment conditions interacted with a dummy for college education, predicting political news knowledge and affective polarization (partisan, ideological, social). 

Result: The paper reports no robust evidence for the hypothesized conditional average treatment effects. In the midline survey, there was a significant interaction (p<0.1) where the Deact+Info treatment increased political news knowledge more for college-educated participants, but this did not persist to the endline. For affective polarization, some significant interactions were found, but they were often contrary to hypotheses (e.g., deactivation increasing partisan polarization for non-college educated) and did not show a consistent pattern.

Result: On the midline survey, the Deactivation Only treatment had a larger positive effect on political news knowledge for younger participants (the negative interaction term was significant: -0.014***).

But little is known about why readers choose to read clickbait stories. Is it merely curiosity, or might voters think such stories are more likely to provide useful information? We conduct a survey experiment in Italy, where a major political party enthusiastically embraced the esthetics of new media and encouraged their supporters to distrust legacy outlets in favor of online news. We offer respondents a monetary incentive for correct answers to manipulate the relative salience of the motivation for accurate information. This incentive increases differences in the preference for clickbait; older and less educated subjects become even more likely to opt to read a story with a clickbait headline when the incentive to produce a factually correct answer is higher. Our model suggests that a politically relevant subset of the population prefers Clickbait Media because they trust it more.","Accuracy incentive salience with three conditions: 
Control (no incentive), 
Intrinsic incentive (told there will be a quiz), 
Monetary incentive (told there will be a quiz + chance at €250 Amazon voucher based on accuracy).","We have three treatment conditions: No Incentive: “Attention! In the next section we will give you the titles of five new articles.

To date, however, this assumption remains largely untested in the political domain. Here, we provide such a test. We begin by drawing a theoretical distinction between two dimensions for which video might be more efficacious than text: 1) one’s belief that a depicted event actually occurred and 2) the extent to which one’s attitudes and behavior are changed. We test this model across two high-powered survey experiments varying exposure to politically persuasive messaging (total n = 7,609 Americans; 26,584 observations). Respondents were shown a selection of persuasive messages drawn from a diverse sample of 72 clips. For each message, they were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: a short video, a detailed transcript of the video, or a control condition. Overall, we find that individuals are more likely to believe an event occurred when it is presented in video versus textual form, but the impact on attitudes and behavioral intentions is much smaller. Importantly, for both dimensions, these effects are highly stable across messages and respondent subgroups. Moreover, when it comes to attitudes and engagement, the difference between the video and text conditions is comparable to, if not smaller than, the difference between the text and control conditions. Taken together, these results call into question widely held assumptions about the unique persuasive power of political video over text.","Communication modality of persuasive messages: 
(1) short video clip, 
(2) detailed transcript of the clip (text), 
(3) control (no new information).","For each message, respondents were then randomly assigned to one of three conditions: 1) the video condition, in which they were asked to watch a short video clip, 2) the text condition, in which they were asked to read a detailed transcription of the video clip, and 3) the control condition, in which no new information was provided.","Believability; 
Attitudinal persuasion; 
Sharing intentions; 
Personal engagement.","Measures. We measured each of our dependent variables using five-point scales. Note that our outcome variables were all based on single-item scales. Although multi-item scales have important benefits, we opted to use single-item scales in light of concerns about the overall length of the survey instrument and the associated risks of respondent attrition and response satisficing (57). First, we asked respondents in the video and text conditions to rate the believability of the content—that is, their perceptions of whether the depicted events actually occurred—using the following format: “To what extent do you believe [the speaker] actually [made a particular claim from the message]?” (1 = Definitely did not happen, 5 = Definitely happened). Second, we asked respondents in all three conditions to rate their attitudes regarding the subject of the message—that is, whether they agreed or disagreed with the core persuasive claim—using the following format: “Please rate the extent to which you agree or disagree with the following statement: [Persuasive claim from the message]” (1 = Strongly disagree, 5 = Strongly agree). Third, in Study 1, we asked all respondents how important the message’s topic was using the following format: “How important is [the subject of the persuasive message] to you, relative to other issues?” (1 = Not at all important, 5 = Extremely important). Fourth, we asked all respondents to rate their interest in learning more about the message’s topic using the following format: “To what extent are you interested in learning more about [the subject of the persuasive message]?” (1 = Not at all interested, 5 = Extremely interested). Lastly, we asked respondents in the video and text conditions to rate their likelihood of sharing the content with others: “How likely would you be to share the message you just saw with a friend or colleague?” (1 = Not at all likely, 5 = Extremely likely).","Outcome: Believability of the content

The first of these studies was fielded on Lucid between March and April of 2021 (Study 1; n = 4,266; 16,735 total observations), and the second was fielded on Dynata in May of 2021 (Study 2; n = 3,343; 9,849 total observations). In both studies, respondents were presented with a random selection of persuasive messages. For each message, respondents were randomly assigned to watch a short video clip, read an annotated transcript of the video clip, or receive no new information (the control condition). We employed a within-subject design in which respondents could be assigned to different experimental conditions for each of the messages they were shown.","The study used Bayesian multilevel linear regression models to analyze the data. The models accounted for the clustered structure of the data, with responses nested within individuals and messages. The primary model estimated the average treatment effect (ATE) of video vs. text exposure. The dependent variables were standardized. The models included random intercepts and random slopes for the treatment effects, varying across both respondents and messages. Vague, weakly informative prior distributions were used for all parameters. The formal specification for the primary analysis was: Yi ~ Normal(μi, σ) μi = φ + λ1video_vs_texti + λ2control_vs_texti φ = α + αJ[i] + αK[i] λ1 = β1 + β1J[i] + β1K[i] λ2 = β2 + β2J[i] + β2K[i] Here, Yi is the outcome for respondent-message pair i, J indexes messages, and K indexes respondents. video_vs_text is a dummy for the video condition (text is the reference), and control_vs_text is a dummy for the control condition.","Analysis Strategy. To test our main hypotheses, we fit a series of Bayesian multilevel linear regression models using the brms package in R (58, 59). For models comparing the effects of video versus text, our primary quantity of interest is the parameter on a dummy variable indicating assignment to the video versus text condition, representing the ATE of exposure to video versus text. However, for our measures of attitudinal persuasion and personal engagement, we also include a second dummy variable indicating assignment to the control versus text condition. We allow the parameters on these two dummy variables (and the intercept) to vary across both respondents and messages (that is, a “maximal” random effects structure; see ref. 60). (From Supporting Information) The formal specification of the model is presented below, where Yi corresponds to one of the five outcome variables described above, i indexes respondent-message pairs, J indexes the vector of parameters for individual messages, K indexes the vector of parameters for individual respondents, and both RJ and RK are 3 × 3 correlation matrices.

We develop a model to investigate the effects of polarization on the likelihood that a society will coordinate on a welfare-improving action in a context in which collective benefits are acquired only if enough individuals take that action. We examine the impacts of different manifestations of polarization: heterogeneity of preferences, segregation of the social network, and the interaction between the two. In this context, heterogeneity captures differential perceived benefits from coordinating, which can lead to different intentions and sensitivity regarding the intentions of others. Segregation of the social network can create a bottleneck in information flows about others’ preferences, as individuals may base their decisions only on their close neighbors. Additionally, heterogeneous preferences can be evenly distributed in the population or clustered in the local network, respectively reflecting or systematically departing from the views of the broader society. The model predicts that heterogeneity of preferences alone is innocuous and it can even be beneficial, while segregation can hamper coordination, mainly when local networks distort the distribution of valuations. We base these results on a multimethod approach including an online group experiment with 750 individuals. We randomize the range of valuations associated with different choice options and the information respondents have about others. The experimental results reinforce the idea that, even in a situation in which all could stand to gain from coordination, polarization can impede social progress.","Valuation heterogeneity (homogeneous low/medium/high; heterogeneous with 5 high-value and 5 low-value players).

Information structure (well-connected / segregated random / segregated biased).","A player’s oi depends on the experimental treatment. In the homogeneous treatments, all players in the group have the same oi, which is either low (£1.50), medium (£2.00), or high (£2.50). In the heterogeneous treatments, there are five high-value players in the group who have an oi of £2.50 and five low-value players who have an oi of £1.50. Notice that these values correspond to the parameters of the model in Fig. 2. We further distinguish between different levels of information available to players when making their decision. In the full information condition, players know all the oi values in the group, including their own, which represents the scenario in which individuals are “well connected.” In the partial information condition, players are informed about the oi values of 4 out of the 10 players, including their own. The information is representative of the actual distribution of the oi values in the group. This implies that participants in the heterogeneous treatment are informed that two players in the group have a high oi value and two other players have a low oi value, while the valuations of the remaining six players remain unknown to them. This condition represents the “segregated random"" scenario because individuals have only partial information, but it can be used to predict the actual distribution of oi values in the group. In the clustered partial information condition, players are again informed about four oi values, including their own, but the information is strongly biased in the direction of their own oi. Specifically, high-value players are informed that there are four high-value players in the group, including themselves, while low-value players are informed that there are four low-value players in the group, including themselves. The valuations of the remaining six players remain unknown. This condition represents the “segregated biased” scenario and is only applicable in the heterogeneous treatments.","Coordination decision (choose risky red vs. safe black).

The payoff for R depends on the number of other players k choosing R, a threshold M, and a subjective valuation o_i. The payoff for S is a fixed benefit b. The equations are: ΠR[k] = o_i if k ≥ M, and 0 otherwise; ΠS[k] = b. The expected payoff difference is Δi = Σ (from k=M-1 to Z-1) [(Z-1 choose k) * t_i^k * (1-t_i)^(Z-1-k)] * o_i - b, where t_i is the belief about others choosing R. The probability of choosing R is modeled as (1 + e^−βΔi)^−1. For the experimental data, the authors use random-effects probit regressions to analyze the binary choice (Red vs. Black card) and random-effects linear regressions for expectations. The models estimate the effect of treatment dummies for information structure (Segregated Random, Segregated Biased, with Well-connected as the base) and valuation level (High, Medium, with Low as the base).

Result: The positive effect of being a high-value player on choosing to coordinate was strongly moderated by the information structure. The effect was modest in the well-connected (coeff=0.1251, p<0.05) and segregated random conditions (coeff=0.1046, p<0.1), but was substantially larger and highly significant in the segregated biased condition (coeff=0.3562, p<0.01).

Result: For low-value players, Segregated Biased information significantly decreased the probability of choosing red compared to the well-connected baseline (coeff = -0.2163, p<0.01). For high-value players, the effect was small and not statistically significant (coeff = 0.0310, p>0.1).

A popular answer argues that human psychology is tailored for face-to-face interaction and people's behavior therefore changes for the worse in impersonal online discussions. We provide a theoretical formalization and empirical test of this explanation: the mismatch hypothesis. We argue that mismatches between human psychology and novel features of online environments could (a) change people's behavior, (b) create adverse selection effects, and (c) bias people's perceptions. Across eight studies, leveraging cross-national surveys and behavioral experiments (total N = 8,434), we test the mismatch hypothesis but only find evidence for limited selection effects. Instead, hostile political discussions are the result of status-driven individuals who are drawn to politics and are equally hostile both online and offline. Finally, we offer initial evidence that online discussions feel more hostile, in part, because the behavior of such individuals is more visible online than offline.","Environment/context: Online vs. Offline (surveys; Study 5 vignette).

vignette experiment (2×2 within-participant); 
two online behavioral experiments (2×8 × position between-subjects).","Instead, we rely on other study designs: Studies 1–4 present a series of approximately representative online surveys in which we observe the same individuals' experiences with political hostility in both online and offline contexts. In these within-subject designs, we also examine how a primary psychological trait (specifically, individual differences in status-seeking) relates to political hostility. To maximize internal validity, Study 5 relies on the popular experimental vignette methodology, inviting participants to imagine themselves in a situation described in a carefully manipulated yet highly realistic scenario. ... We manipulated the context in which the message was uttered in a 2 (online vs. offline) × 2 (private vs. public) within-participant design. Both experiments emulate discussions on Facebook using between-subject experiments and behavioral measures of hostility.

Paired t-tests and equivalence tests are used for within-subject comparisons of hostility levels. Formal tests of differences in coefficients between online and offline contexts are conducted using seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) models within a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework. For behavioral experiments, analyses rely on OLS with fixed effects and multilevel models.","To test our predictions, we employ simple OLS regressions. Unless otherwise noted, our models adjust (or “control”) for basic demographic covariates: age, gender, education, and income in both countries; a standard seven-point partisan identity scale in the US; a three-level (red-block, blue-block, or neither) partisanship variable in Denmark; and also an indicator for identifying as white in the United States. All variables are scaled to 0-1. Although these OLS regression models are effective tools for estimating partial correlations between our variables, they do not directly allow us to contrast online and offline political discussions. Formal tests for the statistical significance of the differences in coefficients rely on structural equation models, reported in detail in online appendix D.","Individual. 

The study analyzes the survey responses and experimental behaviors of individual participants. Key coefficients show a strong individual-level consistency in hostility across contexts (e.g., in Study 1, regressing online hostility on offline hostility yields a coefficient of B=0.885, p<0.001) and that personality traits like status-driven risk taking predict individual hostility (e.g., in Study 1, SDRT coefficient on offline hostility is B=0.29, p<0.001).","In these within-subject designs, we also examine how a primary psychological trait (specifically, individual differences in status-seeking) relates to political hostility. Our objective here is first to provide empirical evidence for the hostility gap and second to test whether people in general report changed behavior, select into discussions, or perceive attacks to be more harmful online than offline.","Hostility Gap: Respondents perceive online discussions as significantly more negative than offline discussions across both the US (ΔM = 0.19, d=0.61) and Denmark (ΔM = 0.32, d=1.1). 

Online vs. Offline Hostility: There is no evidence that people are more hostile online. Self-reported online and offline hostility are very highly correlated (Pearson's r = 0.84 in Study 4) and mean levels are not significantly different across contexts. The regression intercept for online hostility is near zero when offline hostility is zero (S1 US: α=0.006, p<0.01; S2 DK: α=0.003, n.s.). 

Status-Seeking and Hostility: Status-driven risk taking (SDRT) is a robust predictor of hostility both online and offline (e.g., US Study 1: β=0.29 for both online and offline; Denmark Study 2: β=0.40 online, β=0.44 offline; all p<0.001). 

Selection Effects: People with low SDRT scores are less likely to discuss politics online compared to offline (US: Contrast = -0.05, p<0.1; DK: Contrast = -0.09, p<0.001). People with high SDRT scores discuss politics at similar frequencies online and offline. 

Perception Effects: Hostile messages are not perceived as more offensive online than offline (β = -0.01, n.s.). 

Connectivity Effects: People report witnessing more hostility online than offline, and this gap is largest for attacks on strangers (USA: β=0.06, p<0.001; Denmark: β=0.21, p<0.001).","Is there a hostility gap?

Do respondents report more online than offline hostility? No. Figure 2 below reports predicted levels of online hostility as a function of offline hostility (thick line) along with 95% confidence intervals (gray shade) and the observed values for each respondent (jittered points). ... Second, online and offline hostility are strongly related in both the United States and Denmark. Indeed, offline hostility alone explains 64% to 79% of the variance in online hostility. ... The intercepts in all models are very close to zero (S1 US: α = 0.006, p <0.01; S2 DK: α = 0.003, n.s.; S3 US: α = 0.008, n.s.). Respondents reported witnessing more hostility against each of these parties online than offline. However, as Figure 6 demonstrates, the gap between the two environments is largest for witnessing attacks on strangers (USA: β online = 0.06, SE = 0.01, p < 0.001; Denmark: β = 0.21, SE = 0.01, p < 0.001) and much smaller for friends (USA: β online × friends = -0.03, SE = 0.01, p < 0.001; Denmark: β online × friends = -0.14, SE = 0.01, p < 0.001) and the self (USA: β online × self = -0.04, SE = 0.01, p < 0.001; Denmark: β online × self = -0.17, SE = 0.01, p < 0.001).",The paper mentions using 'study designs with high power' to test its claims.,"Thus, despite the use of study designs with high power, the present data do not support the claim that online environments produce radical psychological changes in people.",Context (online vs. offline) × SDRT/trait aggression/emotion regulation; Hostility of target × SDRT (Study 6); Perceived target hostility × emotion regulation (Study 7).,"Is status-driven risk taking a less important correlate of online than offline hostility? No. The association between political hostility and status drive remains constant no matter which environment we look at (US Offline: β = 0.29, US Online: β = 0.29; Denmark Offline: β = 0.44, Denmark Online: β = 0.40, all ps < 0.001). This pattern is obvious from Figure 3: The predicted hostility sharply increases with higher values of status-driven risk taking, but the predictions are completely overlapping for online and offline environments (US: Contrast = 0.004, p = 0.77, DK: Contrast = -0.03, p = 0.12).","Test/Interaction: Context (online vs. offline) moderating the relationship between Status-Driven Risk Taking (SDRT) and hostility. 

Result: No moderation was found.

This finding holds for other personality traits like trait aggression and difficulties in emotion regulation as well. 

Test/Interaction: Hostility of the target post moderating the relationship between SDRT and the likelihood of selecting the political post (Study 6). 

Result: No moderation was found. The hostility of the target had an equally weak negative effect on the probability of choosing the post for people high and low on SDRT. 

Test/Interaction: Perceived target hostility × Emotion regulation on response hostility (Study 7). 

Result: No moderation was found. The relationship between the perceived hostility of the target post and the hostility of the participant's response was not moderated by their difficulties in emotion regulation.","Is status-driven risk taking a less important correlate of online than offline hostility? No. The association between political hostility and status drive remains constant no matter which environment we look at (US Offline: β = 0.29, US Online: β = 0.29; Denmark Offline: β = 0.44, Denmark Online: β = 0.40, all ps < 0.001). This pattern is obvious from Figure 3: The predicted hostility sharply increases with higher values of status-driven risk taking, but the predictions are completely overlapping for online and offline environments (US: Contrast = 0.004, p = 0.77, DK: Contrast = -0.03, p = 0.12).","Age Description: Study 1 (US): M=44.2 (SD=12.91); Study 2 (DK): M=41.17 (SD=13.49); Study 3 (US): M=45.08 (SD=16.56); Study 4 (US): M=42.63 (SD=17.02); Study 5 (US): M=46.00 (SD=17.64); Study 6 (US): M=37.02 (SD=11.39); Study 7 (US): M=38.95 (SD=12.08).
