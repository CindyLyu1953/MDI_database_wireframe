Consistent with previous research, we find greater diffusion for tweets containing moral rhetoric, but this is qualified by moral language valence and elite ideology. For both presidential candidates and Members of Congress, nega tive moral language is associated with increased message diffusion.

Here, we propose that social media users overperceive levels of moral outrage felt by individuals and groups, inflating beliefs about intergroup hostility. Using a Twitter field survey, we measured authors' moral outrage in real time and compared authors' reports to observers' judgements of the authors' moral outrage. We find that observers systematically overperceive moral outrage in authors, inferring more intense moral outrage experiences from messages than the authors of those messages actually reported. This effect was stronger in participants who spent more time on social media to learn about politics. Preregistered confirmatory behavioural experiments found that overperception of individuals' moral outrage causes overperception of collective moral outrage and inflates beliefs about hostile communication norms, group affective polarization and ideological extremity.

One contributor to these related phenomena may be increasing exposure to online political disagreements in which ordinary citizens criticize, and sometimes explicitly demean, opponents. This article presents two experimental studies that assessed whether U.S. partisans' attitudes became more prejudiced in favor of the in-party after exposure to online partisan criticism. In the first study, we draw on an online convenience sample to establish that partisan criticism that derogates political opponents increases affective polarization. In the second, we replicate these findings with a quasi-representative sample and extend the pattern of findings to social polarization. We conclude that online partisan criticism likely has contributed to rising affective and social polarization in recent years between Democrats and Republicans in the United States, and perhaps between partisan and ideological group members in other developed democracies as well.

Nevertheless, there are still very few rigorous empirical studies of the causal impact of social media usage on polarization. To explore this question, we replicate the only published study to date that tests the effects of social media cessation on interethnic attitudes (Asimovic et al., 2021). In a study situated in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the authors found that deactivating from Facebook for a week around genocide commemoration in Bosnia and Herzegovina had a negative effect on users' attitudes toward ethnic outgroups, with the negative effect driven by users with more ethnically homogenous offline networks. Does this finding extend to other settings? In a pre-registered replication study, we implement the same research design in a different ethnically polarized setting: Cyprus. We are not able to replicate the main effect found in Asimovic et al. (2021): in Cyprus, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no effect. We do, however, find a significant interaction between the heterogeneity of users' offline networks and the deactivation treatment within our 2021 subsample, consistent with the pattern from Bosnia and Herzegovina. We also find support for recent findings (Allcott et al., 2020; Asimovic et al., 2021) that Facebook deactivation leads to a reduction in anxiety levels and suggestive evidence of a reduction in knowledge of current news, though the latter is again limited to our 2021 subsample.",Facebook deactivation (7 days),"The treatment group was asked to deactivate from Facebook (and received instructions on how to do so), while the control group was asked to remain active as usual. ...

This article makes three contributions. First, we show that frequent commenters on Facebook are more likely to be interested in politics, to have more polarized opinions, and to use toxic language in comments in an elicitation task. Second, we find that people who comment on articles in the real world use more toxic language on average than the public as a whole; levels of toxicity in comments scraped from media outlet Facebook pages greatly exceed what is observed in comments we elicit on the same articles from a nationally representative sample. Finally, we demonstrate experimentally that exposure to toxic language in comments increases the toxicity of subsequent comments.",Commenting frequency; Exposure to top Facebook comments (two most-liked),"During the survey, we asked YouGov respondents to comment on articles drawn from Facebook. Each respondent was randomly assigned to see three different articles from the Facebook sample. In each case, respondents were presented with a Facebook post from a news outlet and asked whether they would write a comment if they saw the post on Facebook and subsequently what they would write. ... The comment elicitation task also included an embedded survey experiment. To test whether prior comments cause people to make uncivil comments themselves (especially if the prior comments are uncivil), we randomized whether respondents were shown two real comments from Facebook on each post or not. When assigned to the comments condition, respondents were specifically shown the two comments with the most likes for each post, which are frequently highlighted by the Facebook algorithm.","Comment toxicity; Willingness to write a comment; Political engagement/involvement (political interest, political knowledge, partisan strength, need to evaluate); Political polarization (affective and ideological)","To measure comment toxicity, we used the toxicity machine learning model implemented in Google's Perspective API (Wulczyn, Thain, & Dixon, 2017). This model is trained on labeled data from sources including human moderator-tagged online comments in Wikipedia's talk pages and the New York Times comments section. The toxicity score, which ranges from 0 to 1, indicates the predicted proportion of annotators classifying the comment as “a rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable comment that is likely to make people leave a discussion.”","Outcome: Commenting behavior Facebook use

For the observational survey analysis, models regressed political predispositions (e.g., political interest, partisan strength) on indicators of commenting frequency. For partisan polarization, models included an interaction term between partisanship and commenting frequency. 

For the analysis of comment toxicity, toxicity scores were regressed on indicators of commenting frequency or willingness to comment.

All variables are rescaled to 0–1.,"Individual respondent; 
Individual comment","In this table, we verify these graphical findings presented in Figure using linear regression models in which we regress the outcome variables on the treatment, the toxicity of the featured comments, and the interaction between the two. As shown in models 1-5, we do not find a significant treatment effect on willingness to comment. Furthermore, we do not find that (randomized) exposure to top featured comments increases toxicity when averaged across all articles (model 6). However, the toxicity of top comments is significantly associated with the toxicity of respondents’ comments (p < 0.005; model 7). Importantly, this association is much stronger for those assigned to see the featured comments (0.18) than those who weren’t (0.09), and the difference between those quantities (0.09) is statistically significant (p < 0.05; model 8). These results hold when we include article fixed effects (Columns 9–10).","Commenters vs. non-commenters: Commenters have higher political interest (by 11-24 pp, p<.005), political knowledge (p<.005 in ANES/Pew), strong partisanship (p<.005), and need to evaluate (p<.005). 

Toxicity: Real-world Facebook comments are 77% more toxic on average than comments elicited from a representative sample (mean toxicity 0.33 vs. 0.19, p<.005). Frequent commenters in the YouGov survey write more toxic comments than non-commenters (0.22 vs 0.18, p<.005). Toxicity and likes: The number of 'likes' on Facebook comments increases with toxicity up to the 80th percentile of toxicity (score=0.53), and then declines. 

Experimental effects: Exposure to top comments does not affect willingness to comment. Exposure to toxic featured comments increases the toxicity of subsequent comments. Exposure to comments with the highest toxicity (≈.9) increases respondent comment toxicity from 0.21 to 0.33, an effect of approximately 0.5 SD.","The results show that commenters’ self-reported interest in politics is higher than non-commenters by 11–24 percentage points (p <.005 in each case). Habitual commenters are also more likely to be more informed about politics (p <.005 in ANES and Pew; p <.1 in YouGov) and to identify themselves as strong partisans (p <.005 in each case). Furthermore, commenters exhibit significantly stronger need to evaluate (p <.005). The average toxicity scores for the Facebook and YouGov samples are respectively 0.330 and 0.186. In other words, toxicity of real world comments surpasses toxicity of comments by the general public by 77%—a substantial gap. Being exposed to the worst comments in the pool (toxicity ≈.9) increases the toxicity of respondents’ comments from 0.21 to 0.33, an estimated effect of approximately 0.5 standard deviations when featured comment toxicity is at its maximum.

In a randomized online experiment during the 2017 French presidential election campaign, we subjected subgroups of 2480 French voters to alternative facts by the extreme-right candidate, Marine Le Pen, and/or corresponding facts about the European refugee crisis from official sources. We find that: (i) alternative facts are highly persuasive; (ii) fact checking improves factual knowledge of voters (iii) but it does not affect policy conclusions or support for the candidate; (iv) exposure to facts alone does not decrease support for the candidate, even though voters update their knowledge.

Control","Treatment: Alt-Facts You will read several statements by Marine Le Pen about migrants: their reasons for coming and the impact of migrants on French working and retired population; please read them carefully. Screen 1 Reasons to come: the National Front, in its program, promises a drastic reduction of the number of asylum seekers allowed to stay in France. This follows a number of statements by Marine Le Pen about migrants and refugees: 8/9/2015: “A very small minority of them are really political refugees (...) I have seen the pictures of illegal immigrants coming down, who were brought to Germany, to Hungary, etc... Well, on these pictures there are 99% of men (...). Men who leave their country leaving their families behind, it is not to flee persecution but of course for financial reasons. Let's stop telling stories. We are facing an economic migration, these migrants will settle.” 15/09/2015: “Everyone of us has good reasons to flee the war, but there are also some who fight. Imagine during the Second World War, there were surely many French, believe me, who had good reasons to flee the Germans; and yet, they went to fight against the Germans.” Screen 2 Pensions and work: in the program of the Front National, immigration is presented as being used by big firms to push wages down. This follows a number of statements by Marine Le Pen relative to work and retirement benefits going to refugees: 8/12/2016: “Without mentioning the policies that allow people to obtain a minimum pension under the single condition of coming to France and being above 65, i.e., without having ever worked or paid social contributions in France; and we hand out 750 euros per person, 1500 euros for a couple (...) close to you there are farmers who live with 300 or 400 euros.” 27/11/2013: “5% of the foreigners who come to France have a work contract. This means that there is 95% who come to France who are taken care of by our nation (...). There are 95% of people who settle in France who don't work, either because of their age, either because they cannot as there is no work in France.” 08/12/2016: “But they [the immigrant population] do not work. They do not work. There are seven million unemployed in our country. How could they work? They do not work, these lies have to stop.” Treatment: Facts You will read below several numbers and statistics about migrants, related to their reasons to come and their impact on French working and retired population; please read them carefully. Screen 1 Reasons to come According to the UNHCR, among the migrants crossing the Mediterranean in 2015, the vast majority was coming from countries at war or in conflict, 50% were Syrians, 21% Afghans, 9% Iraqis and 4% Eritreans. The UNHCR estimates that among the migrants crossing the Mediterranean in 2015, 17% are women, 25% are children and 58% are men. During the First and Second World Wars, the French fled war zones in much larger numbers than the current refugees. After the defeat of the French army in the North of France in the Spring 1940, 8 million civilians, that is one quarter (25%) of the population of the time, took the road to go to the South of the country that was not occupied (according to Jean-Pierre Azema, a renowned French historian). Screen 2 Pensions and work The “old age minimum” guarantees elderly people a minimum of 801 euros for people above 65. This social benefit is available to all French nationals, under the condition of being below a certain level of income. It is also available to foreigners, under the condition of meeting at least one of the following requirements: have a work visa for the past 10 years. Have the refugee status or benefit from French protection for having fought under the French flag. Be a national from a EU state or from Switzerland. According to the National Statistics Institute (INSEE) in 2015, 54.8% of the immigrant population were in the labor force (working or looking for a job) against 56.3% for the rest of the French population. The rate of unemployment for the immigrant population is 18.1% against 9.1% for the rest of the population. There is therefore 44.9% of the immigrant population that works (51.1% for the rest of the population).

The variation in prior beliefs about the unemployment rate among migrants allows us to study the heterogeneity of the effects of the treatments with respect to prior knowledge. As described above, we measure the correctness of the prior with three dummy variables: correct, overestimated, and underestimated unemployment rate among migrants. Tables A6 and A7 in the online appendix explore potentially relevant dimensions of heterogeneity of treatment effects on the main political outcomes (voting intentions, the dummy for a belief that refugees come for economic reason, and a dummy for agreement with MLP on immigration policy) and on posteriors on facts (absolute value of the distance to truth on the posterior beliefs about the share of men among refugees and absolute value of the distance to truth on the posterior about the share of working among migrants). Each panel of these Tables presents the coefficients on the interaction terms between each treatment and a particular characteristic from five different regressions.","Test/Interaction: Treatment effect heterogeneity by prior knowledge. Models included interaction terms between treatment dummies and a dummy for having a correct prior (vs. overestimated prior). 

Result: The persuasive effects of all three treatments (Alt-Facts, Fact-Check, and Facts) on voting intention for MLP were large, positive, and statistically significant only for the subgroup of respondents who overestimated the unemployment rate among migrants. For this group, the Alt-Facts treatment increased voting intentions by 8.2 pp (p<0.01), Fact-Check by 6.8 pp (p<0.05), and Facts by 4.8 pp (p<0.1). For respondents with correct priors, the effects were small and not significant. The interaction term 'Alt-Facts x Correct prior' was -0.122 (p<0.05), indicating a significantly smaller effect for those with correct priors. 

Test/Interaction: Treatment effect heterogeneity by primary news source (TV vs. others). 

Result: Among those who get news from TV, the Alt-Facts treatment had a significantly larger effect on voting intention (interaction coef. = 0.093, p<0.05) and belief that refugees come for economic reasons (interaction coef. = 0.118, p<0.05). 

Test/Interaction: Treatment effect heterogeneity by income source (receiving social security vs. others). 

Result: Among social security recipients, the Facts treatment had a significantly smaller effect on voting intention (interaction coef. = -0.125, p<0.05). 

Test/Interaction: Treatment effect heterogeneity by education (secondary education vs. others). 

Result: For those with secondary education, the Fact-Check and Facts treatments had a significantly stronger effect on correcting factual knowledge (reducing distance to truth).
