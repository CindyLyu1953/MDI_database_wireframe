# Questionnaire Database Platform - High-Fidelity Prototype Design

## Project Overview

This is a high-fidelity prototype design for a centralized questionnaire database platform, specifically designed to collect and organize key information from social media-related experimental research. The platform aims to address the academic problem where different studies often use similar labels to describe variables but have vastly different operationalization methods.

## Design Philosophy

### Core Features
1. **Smart Search** - Support multi-dimensional search by keywords, authors, journals, etc.
2. **Feature Comparison** - Side-by-side comparison of different studies' measurement methods for the same concepts
3. **Knowledge Integration** - Centralized display of key research information
4. **Multi-User Service** - Serve scholars, journalists, and the general public simultaneously

### Design Features
- **Progressive Information Disclosure** - Display summary version first, expand to full content on click
- **Multi-dimensional Filtering** - Filter by year, journal, research method, etc.
- **Smart Recommendations** - Recommend related studies based on user search history
- **Export Functionality** - Support exporting search results and comparison data

## Page Functionality

### 1. Home Page (index.html)
- Platform introduction and feature showcase
- Search entry and popular search recommendations
- Platform data statistics display
- Responsive design, adapts to different devices

### 2. Search Page (search.html)
- Smart search functionality
- Multi-dimensional filters (year, journal, research method, sorting)
- Search results list display
- Pagination functionality
- Article favorites and comparison features

### 3. Article Details Page (article.html)
- Complete article information display
- Progressive information disclosure (summary + full version)
- Related research recommendations
- Download links and citation formats
- Sidebar information supplements

### 4. Comparison Page (compare.html)
- Side-by-side comparison of multiple articles
- Table format display of key features
- Detailed comparison of measurement tools
- Research design difference analysis
- Comparison summary and insights

### 5. Browse Page (browse.html)
- Browse by topic categories
- Browse by research methods
- Browse by year timeline
- Browse by journal categories
- Category statistics information

### 6. Profile Page (profile.html)
- User information management
- Favorite articles management
- Comparison studies management
- Search history records
- Personal settings and preferences

## Technical Features

### Design Standards
- **Modern UI Design** - Uses modern design language and interaction patterns
- **Responsive Layout** - Adapts to desktop, tablet, mobile and other devices
- **Accessibility Design** - Considers usage needs of different user groups
- **Academic Professional Feel** - Conforms to professional image of academic research tools

### Interaction Design
- **Progressive Information Disclosure** - Avoids information overload, provides hierarchical information display
- **Smart Search** - Supports natural language queries and smart recommendations
- **Multi-dimensional Filtering** - Provides flexible filtering and sorting options
- **One-click Operations** - Simplifies common operation workflows

### Visual Design
- **Color System** - Uses professional blue color scheme
- **Typography System** - Uses system fonts to ensure cross-platform compatibility
- **Icon System** - Uses SVG icons, supports high-resolution display
- **Spacing System** - Unified spacing and layout standards

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Direct Opening
Open the `index.html` file directly in a browser to view the prototype.

### 2. Local Server
```bash
# Using Python to start local server
python -m http.server 8000

# Or using Node.js
npx http-server

# Then access http://localhost:8000 in browser
```

### 3. Import to Design Tools

#### Figma Import
Since Figma cannot directly import HTML files, it is recommended to:
1. Use browser screenshot function to capture each page
2. Import screenshots into Figma as design references
3. Redesign in Figma while maintaining layout and interaction logic

#### Other Design Tools
- **Adobe XD** - Can import HTML as reference
- **Sketch** - Requires manual redesign
- **Framer** - Can import HTML code for secondary development

## Design Recommendations

### 1. User Experience Optimization
- Add loading states and error handling
- Implement search suggestions and autocomplete
- Optimize mobile interaction experience
- Add keyboard shortcut support

### 2. Feature Extensions
- Add user authentication and permission management
- Implement real-time search and filtering
- Add data visualization features
- Support multi-language interface

### 3. Technical Implementation
- Use modern frontend frameworks (React/Vue/Angular)
- Integrate backend API and database
- Implement user state management
- Add offline functionality support

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

## Important Notes

1. This prototype is implemented with static HTML/CSS and does not include backend functionality
2. All interactive features are for demonstration purposes and require backend support
3. Data is simulated and needs to be connected to real data sources for actual use
4. It is recommended to refactor using modern frontend frameworks during development
